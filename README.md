# 🖼️ Image Extension GAN — Step-by-Step Guide

This repository provides a hands-on implementation of **Image Outpainting (Extension)** using **TensorFlow Hub**.  
The technique reconstructs and extends missing regions of an image, generating visually coherent completions that blend seamlessly with the original content.

🔹 [Extensão de Imagens com GAN — Guia Passo a Passo (Portuguese)](./Extensão%20de%20Imagens%20com%20GAN%20-%20Guia%20Passo%20a%20Passo.pdf)  
🔹 [Image Extension GAN — Step-by-Step Guide (English)](./Image%20Extension%20GAN%20-%20Step-by-Step%20Guide.pdf)

Each guide explains in detail how to:
- Import essential libraries (TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL).  
- Load and preprocess input images (crop, resize, normalize).  
- Use pre-trained **Boundless** models from **TensorFlow Hub**.  
- Generate and visualize reconstructed images side by side (original, masked, completed).
